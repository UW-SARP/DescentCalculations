	UW-SARP/DescentCalculations

What is it?
-----------

The descent calculations are multiple graphs to provide simulation data on key factors
during the descent of the Rocket. Original calculation code designed by Zach Perry. 
GUI (Graphical User Interface) developed by Brandt Monson.  The current avionics & recovery
team (15-16) hopes to improve and add upon the GUI, code-wise and calculation-wise.

The GUI features editable values, which are as follows:

-Area of the Main Parachute (Units?)!!
-Opening Shock Factor (Units?)!!
-Final Altitude (Ground Level, in ft)
-Initial Altitude (ft)
-Initial Velocity (ft/s)
-Time Step (s)
-Rocket Dry Weight (lb)
-Acceleration due to gravity (ft/s^2)

Latest Version
--------------

The latest version and documentation can be found on UW-SARP's public repository
on Github.com at https://github.com/UW-SARP/DescentCalculations. The repository
can also be found via a search with the keywords UW-SARP or DescentCalculations.

Files
-----

Currently the GUI consists of three files, all of which are required to run the 
program. The files and a short description are listed as follows:

DescentCalculations.fig  - MATLAB figure file, essentially the "program" to run
			                     the GUI. 
DescentCalculations.m    - MATLAB code file, contains the code used by the .fig
			                     file to run the GUI. This is the part that will mainly
			                     be edited.
Standard Atmosphere.xlsx - Excel spreadsheet containing standard temperatures and
			                     pressures for a range of altitudes. Altitude values 
			                     range from 0 to 80000 and increment by 50. 

Installation/Use
----------------

A copy of MATLAB by MathWorks is required to run the GUI. A trial of MATLAB can be
obtained from the official MathWorks website at http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/
The software can also be purchased from the MathWorks website. However for UW faculty
and students, a one-year license of MATLAB can be obtained through UW's IT-connect
program. The link to the information page follows: 
https://www.washington.edu/itconnect/wares/uware/matlab/

To run the GUI (Graphical User Interface), first install MATLAB. Then make sure all
the files are in the same folder, and then open the DescentCalculations.fig file.
To edit the code, open the DescentCalculations.m file in MATLAB.
